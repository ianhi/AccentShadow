# Audio Processing Guide - AccentShadow

## Overview

AccentShadow performs sophisticated audio processing to optimize your pronunciation practice experience. This guide explains what happens to your audio from upload to playback, ensuring transparency and helping you understand the technology behind the app.

## 🎯 Processing Pipeline

### 1. **Audio Upload & Format Handling**

**What happens when you upload audio:**
- **Format Detection**: Supports MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG, and WebM formats
- **Browser Compatibility**: Audio is decoded using the Web Audio API for consistent cross-browser behavior
- **Sample Rate Standardization**: All audio is processed at 44.1kHz for optimal compatibility
- **Metadata Extraction**: Duration and audio characteristics are analyzed

**Technical Details:**
- Uses `AudioContext.decodeAudioData()` for reliable format handling
- Maintains original audio quality while ensuring browser compatibility
- Automatic format conversion when necessary

### 2. **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**

**Intelligent Speech Detection:**
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses the Silero VAD model for accurate speech detection
- **Silence Trimming**: Automatically removes leading and trailing silence
- **Speech Boundaries**: Identifies precise start and end points of speech
- **Padding Strategy**: Adds 200ms padding before speech onset for natural timing

**VAD Process:**
1. **Audio Analysis**: Scans audio in 400ms overlapping blocks
2. **Speech Detection**: Identifies speech vs. silence using advanced algorithms
3. **Boundary Refinement**: Fine-tunes speech start/end points
4. **Padding Application**: Adds consistent 200ms pre-padding for alignment

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Consistent timing across different recordings
- ✅ Removes distracting background noise periods
- ✅ Optimizes audio for pronunciation comparison
- ✅ Maintains natural speech rhythm

### 3. **Cross-Browser Audio Alignment**

**Solving Browser Inconsistencies:**
- **Chrome vs Firefox**: Different browsers process audio timing differently
- **320ms Pre-Padding Solution**: Ensures consistent playback timing across browsers
- **Sample Rate Normalization**: Handles different recording sample rates uniformly
- **Onset Synchronization**: Aligns speech start points to 200ms mark precisely

**Technical Implementation:**
```
Original Audio: [silence][speech][silence]
After VAD:      [200ms padding][speech][trimmed silence]
Result:         Consistent speech onset at 200ms mark
```

### 4. **Smart Audio Alignment**

**When you record after uploading target audio:**
- **Duration Matching**: Automatically adjusts audio lengths for comparison
- **Speech Synchronization**: Aligns speech onsets between target and user recordings
- **Padding Strategy**: Adds end-padding to shorter audio to match durations
- **Quality Preservation**: Maintains original speech content without distortion

**Alignment Methods:**
1. **Onset Synchronized**: Both recordings start speech at the same time point
2. **Duration Matched**: Ensures both recordings have identical total length
3. **End Padding**: Adds silence to shorter recordings rather than stretching

### 5. **Volume Normalization**

**Intelligent Loudness Matching:**
- **LUFS Analysis**: Uses ITU-R BS.1770 standard for perceptual loudness measurement
- **Smart Balancing**: Automatically adjusts volume levels for fair comparison
- **Safety Limits**: Prevents over-amplification while allowing proper attenuation
- **Real-time Processing**: Applied during playback without altering original files

**How Volume Normalization Works:**

#### **Loudness Analysis**
- **LUFS Measurement**: Analyzes perceptual loudness (-∞ to 0 LUFS scale)
- **RMS Calculation**: Measures average audio energy
- **Peak Detection**: Identifies maximum audio levels
- **Categorization**: Classifies audio as Very Quiet, Quiet, Normal, Loud, or Very Loud

#### **Normalization Strategies**
1. **Average Mode** (Default): Balances both recordings to their average level
2. **Target Mode**: Adjusts user recording to match target audio level
3. **User Mode**: Adjusts target audio to match user recording level

#### **Smart Reference Selection**
- **Large Differences (>12dB)**: Uses -18 LUFS target for speech optimization
- **Similar Levels**: Averages the two recordings for balanced comparison
- **Extreme Cases**: Applies safety limits to prevent audio distortion

#### **Gain Calculation Examples**
```
Scenario 1 - Quiet User Recording:
Target: -20.6 LUFS (Normal)
User:   -41.2 LUFS (Very Quiet)
Result: User amplified 6x (15.6dB boost), Target slightly boosted

Scenario 2 - Loud User Recording:
Target: -18.0 LUFS (Normal)
User:   -6.0 LUFS (Very Loud)
Result: User attenuated 0.3x (-10dB), Target unchanged
```

### 6. **Playback Modes**

**Different ways to experience your audio:**

#### **Individual Playback**
- **Play Target**: Hear the target pronunciation with normalization applied
- **Play Recording**: Hear your recording with normalization applied
- **Consistent Volume**: Same loudness as overlapping mode for fair comparison

#### **Overlapping Playback**
- **Simultaneous**: Both recordings play at the same time
- **Volume Matched**: Intelligent normalization ensures fair volume comparison
- **Timing Aligned**: Speech onsets synchronized for optimal comparison

#### **Sequential Playback**
- **Target First**: Target audio plays, then your recording follows
- **Configurable Delay**: Adjustable pause between recordings (0-2000ms)
- **Smooth Transitions**: Natural flow between audio segments

## ⚙️ Technical Specifications
