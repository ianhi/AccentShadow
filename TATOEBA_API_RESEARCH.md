# Tatoeba API Research for AccentShadow Integration

## Research Status: Incomplete - Requires Further Investigation

**Note**: Research was stopped before completion. This document contains initial findings and areas that need further investigation.

## Initial Findings

### What is Tatoeba?
- Community-driven sentence database for language learning
- Contains sentences in multiple languages with translations
- Some sentences have audio recordings from native speakers
- Available at https://tatoeba.org

### API Endpoint Discovered
- API endpoint exists: https://tatoeba.org/en/api_v0/search
- Appears to be a RESTful API
- Version 0 suggests it may be in development/beta

## Areas Requiring Investigation

### Critical Questions to Answer:
1. **Authentication Requirements**
   - Does the API require API keys?
   - Can it be accessed without server-side authentication?
   - What are the registration requirements?

2. **CORS Compatibility**
   - Does the API include proper CORS headers for browser access?
   - Can client-side JavaScript make direct requests?
   - Are there domain restrictions?

3. **Audio File Access**
   - How are audio files served?
   - What formats are available (MP3, OGG, etc.)?
   - Are audio URLs direct or require additional API calls?
   - Do audio URLs expire or have access restrictions?

4. **Language Filtering**
   - How to filter sentences by target language?
   - Are language codes standardized (ISO 639)?
   - Can we filter by audio availability?

5. **Rate Limiting**
   - What are the rate limits for API requests?
   - Are there daily/monthly quotas?
   - How are limits enforced?

6. **Licensing and Usage Terms**
   - What license covers the content?
   - Are there restrictions on commercial use?
   - Attribution requirements?

7. **Data Structure**
   - What does the API response format look like?
   - How are sentences, translations, and audio linked?
   - Metadata available (speaker info, quality ratings)?

## Next Steps for Research

1. **API Documentation Review**
   - Look for official API documentation
   - Check developer resources or GitHub repositories
   - Review community forums for usage examples

2. **Direct API Testing**
   - Test API endpoints with sample requests
   - Check response headers for CORS information
   - Verify authentication requirements

3. **Community Investigation**
   - Check Tatoeba community forums
   - Look for existing integrations or tools
   - Contact maintainers if needed

4. **Alternative Assessment**
   - If direct API access isn't feasible, investigate:
     - Data exports/dumps
     - Third-party APIs or wrappers
     - Web scraping possibilities (last resort)

## Preliminary Assessment

**Potential Benefits**:
- Large database of real sentences
- Community-driven content
- Multiple languages supported
- Free/open-source oriented

**Potential Challenges**:
- API may be in beta/development
- Unknown CORS support
- Unclear licensing terms
- Possible rate limiting

## Integration Strategy

**If Feasible**: Could provide excellent source of practice sentences with native audio
**If Not Feasible**: Consider alternative approaches:
- User-uploaded content from Tatoeba
- Integration with other sentence databases
- Manual curation of practice content

**Research Status**: Requires completion of investigation before implementation decisions can be made.
